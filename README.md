# january_sale
Contracts and test for the January sale toy problem.

### To use:

1. `git clone https://github.com/0xMacro/january_sale.git`
2. `cd january_sale`
3. `npm install`
4. `npx hardhat test`

The challenge is to get the test to pass by editing `contracts/CheatingBidder.sol`, without making any changes to `contracts/JanuarySaleItem.sol` or `test/Sale.js`
